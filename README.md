### hash
___
Simple command usable in command line via Python (tested for PS7), calculating and comparing file hashes, recursively for directories. Supports a multiprocessing.

It's made for my personal use, but do whatever you want with that. I made it because Windows' Get-FileHash sucks.
It's not fancy or uniform whatsoever, but maybe I'll improve it someday.
